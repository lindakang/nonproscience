<p>Dengue Fever remains a critical public health challenge in tropical and subtropical regions like Taiwan, where <em>Aedes</em> vectors thrive in hot and humid environments. While not endemic to North America, the risk of imported cases in travellers is rising. With no specific antiviral treatments available, management relies heavily on prevention.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 3 commercial vaccines. While <strong>Sanofi’s Dengvaxia®</strong> is limited to seropositive patients, <strong>Takeda’s Qdenga</strong> has emerged as a broader alternative. Recently announced 7-year Phase III data confirm its efficacy and safety profile. Although approved by the EMA and over 40 countries, it remains unauthorized in Canada, the US, and Taiwan. Meanwhile, Brazil has expanded access via its locally produced <strong>Butantan-DV</strong>.</p>

<h3>The First Isolated Strain</h3>
<p>The dengue virus was first isolated by Japanese virologists <strong>Susumu Hotta (堀田進)</strong> and his advisor, <strong>Dr. Ren Kimura (木村廉)</strong>. Hotta, born in Osaka in 1918, graduated with an MD from the Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto Imperial University (now Kyoto University) in 1942 before conducting research on infectious diseases under Dr. Kimura.</p>
<p>During World War II, a massive dengue outbreak occurred in Japan between 1942 and 1944, introduced by soldiers returning from Southeast Asia during the Pacific War. Nagasaki was the most severely affected city. In 1943, Hotta successfully isolated the virus from a patient in Nagasaki. The findings were published in the <em>Journal of Infectious Diseases</em> in 1952. This isolate, named the <strong>Mochizuki strain (Dengue virus type 1)</strong> after the patient, was the world’s first identified dengue virus strain.</p>

<h3>Virology</h3>
<p>Dengue virus (<em>Orthoflavivirus denguei</em>) belongs to the same family as the Yellow Fever virus, the <strong>Flaviviridae</strong>. It is a large (+)ssRNA virus with a genome of approximately 11 kb, with a size of ~50 nm in diameter, and covered with a lipid envelope, rendering it susceptible to common disinfectants. The genome encodes a long polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved into 10 proteins after entering host cells and starting replication.</p>

</div>


<h4>Serotypes</h4>
<p>There are 4 serotypes: <strong>DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4</strong>. These serotypes share approximately 65% genomic similarity. Infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity to that specific type but only transient cross-immunity to the others.</p>

<h4>Viral Proteins</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Structural Proteins:</strong> C (Capsid), prM/M (Membrane), E (Envelope)</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Structural Proteins (NS):</strong> NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3 (protease & helicase; essential for viral replication), NS4A, NS4B, NS5 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for RNA replication)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epidemiology</h3>
<p>Dengue is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. Transmission typically peaks during the rainy season, as high temperatures and stagnant water facilitate mosquito breeding.</p>
<p>There are no established populations of competent vectors (mosquitoes) in Canada. All cases are imported, with the highest risk found in travellers returning from the Caribbean, Central/South America, and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3>Clinical Presentation</h3>
<p><strong>Incubation Period:</strong> Typically 4–10 days (range: 3–14 days). Symptoms persist for approximately 2–7 days.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dengue Fever:</strong> Sudden high fever (40°C), headache, retro-orbital pain (pain behind the eyes), severe muscle and joint pain (Breakbone fever), nausea, vomiting, and rash.</li>
    <li><strong>Severe Dengue:</strong> Critical symptoms often manifest after fever subsides (within 24–48 hours). Signs include severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, mucosal bleeding (gums/nose), extreme fatigue, and restlessness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stability and Transmission</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inactivation:</strong> The virus is inactivated by heating at 56°C for 30 minutes. Due to its lipid envelope, it is susceptible to 70% ethanol and 1% bleach.</li>
    <li><strong>Survival:</strong> Survival on dry surfaces is brief, but the virus can survive for extended periods in blood or infected mosquitoes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Transmission Routes</h4>
<p>Transmitted via mosquito bites. It is not spread directly through respiratory droplets or casual contact.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Aedes aegypti</em>:</strong> Primary vector. Found mostly in tropical/subtropical zones; prefers indoor habitats.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Aedes albopictus</em>:</strong> Primary vector. Highly adaptable and cold-tolerant (expanding range in North America and Europe); prefers outdoor vegetation and container habitats.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pathogenesis & Infection Mechanism</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Entry:</strong> The Envelope (E) protein binds to host cell surface receptors (e.g., heparan sulphate), entering via receptor-mediated endocytosis.</li>
    <li><strong>Fusion:</strong> The acidic environment of the endosome alters the E protein structure, triggering fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane, releasing viral RNA into the cytoplasm.</li>
    <li><strong>Replication & Translation:</strong> The viral RNA serves as mRNA to translate the polyprotein. Genomic replication occurs in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).</li>
    <li><strong>Assembly & Release:</strong> The polyprotein is cleaved by viral (NS3) and host proteases. Viral particles assemble and are released via exocytosis.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE)</h4>
<p>A critical factor in pathogenesis. If an individual with prior immunity to one serotype (e.g., DENV-1) is infected by a different serotype (e.g., DENV-2), pre-existing non-neutralizing antibodies bind to the new virus. This complex facilitates viral entry into monocytes/macrophages, enhancing replication and triggering a Cytokine Storm, which can lead to severe hemorrhage and shock.</p>

<h3>Treatment & Management</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Currently no approved antiviral treatments.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Development Update:</strong> Mosnodenvir, an oral small-molecule drug developed by Sanofi, showed promising prophylactic results in a recent NEJM publication. However, the trial was halted after Johnson & Johnson (J&J) exited the infectious disease market in 2024 to focus on oncology and chronic diseases. Negotiations are ongoing to find a partner to resume development.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Supportive Care:</strong> Aggressive hydration and rest.</li>
    <li><strong>Symptom Relief:</strong> Acetaminophen / Paracetamol.</li>
    <li><strong>Contraindications:</strong> <span style="color: #cf222e; font-weight: bold;">Strictly avoid Aspirin and NSAIDs (e.g., Ibuprofen)</span> as they inhibit platelet function and increase bleeding risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vaccines</h3>
<p>Currently, there are 3 commercial vaccines, and all are live-attenuated.</p>

<h4>1. Dengvaxia® (Sanofi / CYD-TDV)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Indication:</strong> Only for individuals aged 9 — 45 with laboratory-confirmed prior dengue infection.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> In seronegative individuals (those who have never had dengue), this vaccine may increase the risk of severe dengue (including hemorrhagic fever) and ADE upon future infection. Therefore, it is only recommended for children in endemic areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> In 2024, Sanofi announced it would stop production due to insufficient market demand, though existing stock remains available for eligible individuals.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Qdenga (Takeda / TAK-003)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Tetravalent, live-attenuated vaccine constructed from a DENV-2 backbone (PDK-53 strain) expressing the E and prM proteins of all four serotypes.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficacy:</strong> Phase 3 data indicate 80.2% efficacy against infection at one year and 61.2% at 4.5 years. A booster administered at 4.5 years provided 74.3% protection two years later.</li>
    <li><strong>Regulatory Status:</strong> Approved in 41 countries and listed as a prequalified vaccine by the WHO. However, it is not yet approved in the US or Taiwan, nor is it authorized by Health Canada. Unlike Dengvaxia, it can be administered regardless of prior dengue infection history and is recommended for travellers to endemic regions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Butantan-DV (Instituto Butantan / Brazil)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Single-dose, live-attenuated tetravalent vaccine originally developed by the U.S. NIH.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficacy:</strong> Early data indicate 89.5% efficacy against DENV-1 and 69.6% efficacy against DENV-2 over two years.</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Currently licensed only in Brazil.</li>
</ul>
