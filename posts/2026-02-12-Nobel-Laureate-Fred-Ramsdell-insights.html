<p>Endpoints News interviewed Nobel Laureate <strong>Dr. Fred Ramsdell</strong> at this year’s JPM conference. Dr. Ramsdell identified the <strong>FOXP3 gene</strong>, the master regulator of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this interview, Dr. Ramsdell discussed critical pillars for the industry: effective communication, the "fit for purpose" approach to research, and the future dynamics of the biotechnology sector.</p>

<h3>Key Themes</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> There is a significant disconnect between the scientific community and the public. Scientists must prioritize listening over lecturing to communicate the value of their work effectively to non-scientists.</li>
    <li><strong>“Fit for purpose” approach:</strong> Before every experiment, ask a simple, rigorous question: “Will I learn anything useful from doing this experiment?”</li>
    <li><strong>Biotech industry dynamics:</strong> Despite current economic volatility, the cell therapy sector is experiencing a moment similar to the early days of monoclonal antibodies. Long-term investment will determine success.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communication with the Public</h3>
<p>Public trust is not a soft or secondary concern. It is the fundamental bedrock upon which the biotech industry is built. It dictates funding, shapes policy, and ultimately determines our license to operate. As Dr. Ramsdell frames it, this is the most critical issue we face.</p>

<h4 style="color: #627999;">The Failure of "Lecturing"</h4>
<p>The problem is not a failure of science; it is a failure of communication. As he notes, scientists are “incredibly good at talking to each other.” However, they are far less effective at communicating with those outside their field.</p>
<p>This communication gap has direct and serious consequences. When scientists fail to clearly communicate the value and integrity of their work, they create a vacuum that is quickly filled by misunderstanding and mistrust. By ceding the narrative, they jeopardize both public and private support, which fuels innovation and discovery.</p>

<h4 style="color: #627999;">From Monologue to Dialogue</h4>
<p>Scientists must adopt a new strategy for public engagement by shifting from monologue to dialogue. Simply telling people they are wrong is not only ineffective; it is counterproductive. Researchers must learn to listen and develop the skills to address misunderstandings and misinformation with empathy and clarity.</p>
<p>Following his Nobel Prize win, Dr. Ramsdell described the “privilege” of having a voice that most people do not. He feels a responsibility not to waste it. The future of biopharma depends not only on conversations held in boardrooms and laboratories, but also on those conducted in the public square.</p>

<h3>The “Fit for Purpose” Approach</h3>
<p>Pursuing new discoveries is not enough; researchers must also critically reassess and refine the tools and technologies used to achieve them. A core component of this evolution is honestly evaluating long-standing research models. Before conducting any experiment, scientists should ask: <em>“Will I learn anything useful from doing this experiment?”</em></p>

<h4 style="color: #627999;">Re-evaluating Mouse Models</h4>
<p>Although Dr. Ramsdell’s Nobel-winning work was conducted in mice, his perspective on their use today is nuanced and pragmatic. His assessment offers a framework for evaluating preclinical models:</p>

<table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0; font-size: 14px;">
  <thead>
    <tr style="background-color: #f6f8fa; text-align: left;">
      <th style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #d0d7de;">Application of Mouse Models</th>
      <th style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #d0d7de;">Ramsdell’s Assessment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #d0d7de;"><strong>Fundamental Immunology</strong></td>
      <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #d0d7de;"><strong>“Excellent”</strong> – The foundational mechanisms of the mouse immune system are remarkably similar to those of humans.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #d0d7de;"><strong>Disease Models</strong></td>
      <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #d0d7de;"><strong>“Terrible”</strong> – Mice are not predictive for chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis because they rely on acute models that do not replicate human disease progression.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #d0d7de;"><strong>Toxicology</strong></td>
      <td style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #d0d7de;"><strong>“Bad”</strong> – Mice are limited in their predictive value for toxicology assessments.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For too long, the industry has operated with a “checkbox” mentality, conducting preclinical studies simply because they have traditionally been required. This approach must evolve. Instead, companies should adopt a rigorous, case-by-case evaluation of experimental design.</p>

<h3>Biotech Industry Dynamics</h3>
<p>Scientific potential is meaningless without a robust and forward-thinking industrial engine to support it. To realize the promise of next-generation medicine, the biotech sector must confront economic pressures while maintaining a long-term innovation strategy.</p>

<h4 style="color: #627999;">Deja Vu: Cell Therapy vs. Monoclonal Antibodies</h4>
<p>Many companies are navigating a challenging financial environment. Layoffs have occurred as organizations pivot from discovery research to the significantly more expensive process of clinical development. However, as Dr. Ramsdell notes, this is “not a new phenomenon.”</p>
<p>The skepticism currently surrounding cell therapy mirrors the doubts expressed about monoclonal antibodies in the 1990s. At that time, critics argued that antibodies were too large, too expensive, too difficult to manufacture, and too challenging to deliver. “They’ll never be drugs,” some claimed. History has proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Cell therapy now occupies a similar position. The criticisms are familiar: complexity and cost. Yet as compelling clinical data demonstrating profound patient responses continue to emerge, history suggests the field will overcome these concerns.</p>

<h4 style="color: #627999;">The Long Game</h4>
<p>The greatest threat to progress is not biological complexity or technological limitation—it is short-term thinking. Dr. Ramsdell highlights the risk posed by an investment culture heavily focused on immediate returns.</p>
<p>Breakthrough innovation in medicine requires sustained commitment. While short-term milestones are necessary, transformative therapies are developed over years, not quarters. Sacrificing future cures for quarterly performance metrics would be a profound strategic error.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The biotech industry stands at a pivotal moment. Securing leadership in the next era of medicine rests on three foundational pillars:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Rebuilding public trust</strong> through stronger communication and active listening.</li>
    <li><strong>Embracing a new era</strong> in which technological capability aligns with biological understanding, enabling curative therapies.</li>
    <li><strong>Committing to long-term investment strategies</strong> that prioritize breakthrough innovation over short-term gains.</li>
</ol>
<p>Executives, investors, and scientists must go beyond their formal roles. They must become advocates for science itself—using their influence to communicate its value and deploying capital to support ambitious, long-term initiatives capable of transforming human health.</p>
