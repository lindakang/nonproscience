<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development. As of 2025, the understanding of ADHD has evolved from a simplistic “chemical imbalance” model to a sophisticated neurobiological framework involving multiple neurotransmitter systems and neural circuits.</p>

<p>As the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, ADHD affects approximately 7.2% to 11% of children globally. Longitudinal data indicate that ADHD persists into adulthood in approximately 4% to 5% of the general population, representing roughly 60% of individuals diagnosed during childhood. Furthermore, emerging population-based cohort studies challenge the traditional “childhood-onset” requirement, suggesting that up to 20% of adult cases may first manifest clinically significant symptoms during late adolescence or young adulthood. This phenomenon has been described as <strong>“late-onset” ADHD</strong>.</p>

<h3>Diagnosis and Symptoms</h3>
<p>The clinical diagnosis of ADHD is based on criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The diagnosis requires a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity–impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. Symptoms must be present for at least six months, with an age of onset before 12 years. Additionally, symptoms must occur in more than one setting (e.g., home and school or work) and be developmentally and culturally inappropriate for the individual.</p>

<p>ADHD is phenotypically heterogeneous and is stratified into three primary clinical presentations, which guide treatment decisions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Predominantly Inattentive Presentation (ADHD-I):</strong> Characterized by difficulty sustaining attention, poor organizational skills, and a tendency to abandon tasks. This presentation is frequently underdiagnosed because it lacks overt hyperactive or disruptive behaviours.</li>
    <li><strong>Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation (ADHD-H):</strong> Defined by excessive motor activity, fidgeting, difficulty remaining seated, and impulsive decision-making. This presentation is most commonly identified in early childhood.</li>
    <li><strong>Combined Presentation (ADHD-C):</strong> The most prevalent form of ADHD, meeting diagnostic criteria for both inattentive and hyperactive–impulsive symptom domains.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mechanism of Action: Pathophysiology of ADHD</h3>
<p>The core neurobiological dysfunction in ADHD is believed to involve dysregulation of catecholaminergic signalling—primarily <strong>dopamine (DA)</strong> and <strong>norepinephrine (NE)</strong>, within executive control networks of the brain.</p>

<h4>The Catecholamine Hypothesis</h4>
<p>The prevailing hypothesis centers on the hypofunction of dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basal ganglia (particularly the striatum).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dopamine (DA):</strong> Dopamine modulates D1 receptor activity to reduce background “noise,” thereby enhancing focus on task-relevant stimuli. Insufficient dopamine signalling in the PFC reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, manifesting as impaired attention, working memory deficits, and reduced motivation. In the striatum, dopamine dysregulation contributes to impulsivity and motor hyperactivity.</li>
    <li><strong>Norepinephrine (NE):</strong> Norepinephrine enhances "signal" strength by increasing representational knowledge through the activation of the α2A receptor. It is critical for modulating cortical arousal and attention. Its deficiency in the PFC impairs the ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli and focus on goal-directed tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Emerging Neurotransmitter Systems</h4>
<p>Beyond catecholamines, additional neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in ADHD pathophysiology, opening avenues for novel therapeutic strategies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Glutamate:</strong> The primary excitatory neurotransmitter. Dysregulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) has been associated with a subset of ADHD cases, implicating altered synaptic plasticity and cognitive control.</li>
    <li><strong>Serotonin (5-HT):</strong> Although not a primary therapeutic target, serotonergic modulation is under investigation, particularly for addressing comorbid anxiety, mood instability, and impulsivity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Standard Care & Medications</h3>
<p>The standard of care for ADHD is a multimodal approach, combining psychoeducation, behavioural therapy, and pharmacological intervention.</p>

<h4 style="color: #627999;">First-Line: Central Nervous System (CNS) Stimulants</h4>
<p>Stimulants remain the most effective pharmacological treatment, acting primarily by increasing the synaptic concentration of DA and NE.</p>

<p><strong>Safety and Limitations:</strong> Common adverse effects include decreased appetite (reported in up to 80% of patients), weight loss, insomnia, and headaches. As Schedule II controlled substances, stimulants carry a risk of diversion and misuse. However, evidence indicates that appropriate therapeutic use in individuals with ADHD does not increase the risk of substance use disorders.</p>

<h4 style="color: #627999;">Second-Line: Non-Stimulants</h4>
<p>Non-stimulant medications are indicated when stimulants are poorly tolerated, contraindicated, or when 24-hour coverage is necessary. They are critical for the ~20% of patients who are stimulant-refractory.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The field of ADHD pharmacotherapy is undergoing a significant evolution. While the catecholamine hypothesis remains central, the development of multi-target agents like Centanafadine and the exploration of non-catecholaminergic pathways (e.g., glutamate and orexin systems) are creating a personalized treatment landscape. These advancements promise better-tolerated options for the diverse spectrum of individuals affected by ADHD.</p>
