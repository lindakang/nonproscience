<p>Menopause typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, with the average onset around 49 to 51 years. This age range can vary by region due to factors such as genetics, ethnicity, nutrition, and access to healthcare.</p>
<p>Before menopause, there is a transition period known as <strong>perimenopause</strong>, which is characterized by fluctuating and declining levels of estrogen and progesterone. Perimenopause usually begins in the mid-40s and progresses into menopause, which is defined as the absence of a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months.</p>

<p>Hot flashes and night sweats are collectively referred to as <strong>vasomotor symptoms (VMS)</strong>. For decades, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been the primary treatment for managing VMS. However, MHT is not suitable for patients with oncologic or thrombotic risks, which has increased the demand for non-hormonal therapies targeting the underlying neurobiology of hot flashes, particularly the <strong>kisspeptin-neurokinin B-dynorphin (KNDy)</strong> neuron system in the hypothalamus.</p>

<h3>Mechanism of Pathophysiology</h3>
<p>Human core body temperature is tightly regulated within a <strong>thermoneutral zone</strong>, and fluctuations in estrogen narrow this zone.</p>
<p>In a <strong>eugonadal state</strong>, estrogen maintains a wide thermoneutral zone, allowing the body to tolerate minor fluctuations in core or ambient temperature without triggering a thermoregulatory response.</p>
<p>During the <strong>menopausal transition</strong>, declining levels of 17β-estradiol cause this zone to contract significantly. Consequently, small elevations in core temperature that would previously be ignored by the hypothalamus now trigger heat-dissipation responses. This heightened sensitivity manifests as peripheral vasodilation (flushing) and profuse sweating, followed by evaporative cooling.</p>

<h4>The KNDy Neuron Hypothesis</h4>
<p>The molecular mechanism linking estrogen withdrawal to thermoregulatory narrowing resides in the <strong>infundibular nucleus</strong> of the hypothalamus. This region contains a specialized population of neurons known as <strong>KNDy neurons</strong>, which co-express three distinct neuropeptides:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kisspeptin:</strong> A neuropeptide encoded by the <em>KISS1</em> gene, crucial for the regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).</li>
    <li><strong>Neurokinin B (NKB):</strong> A tachykinin peptide encoded by the <em>TAC3</em> gene, which activates KNDy neurons.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynorphin:</strong> An endogenous opioid peptide that binds to kappa-opioid receptors (KOR) and terminates KNDy neural activity.</li>
</ul>

    <p class="image-caption">The KNDy neuron system and thermoregulation</p>
</div>

<p>These neurons are enriched in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and are highly sensitive to circulating estradiol (E2). Under premenopausal conditions, circulating estrogen exerts <strong>negative feedback</strong> on KNDy neurons, restraining their activity.</p>
<p>During perimenopause and menopause, the decline of ovarian estrogen removes this inhibitory control, leading to <strong>hypertrophy and hyperactivity</strong> of KNDy neurons. This results in excessive release of <strong>Neurokinin B (NKB)</strong>, which binds to NK3 receptors (NK3R) in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO)—the brain’s thermoregulatory center. The MnPO interprets these signals as elevated systemic heat, triggering intense heat-loss mechanisms (hot flashes).</p>

<h3>Current Standard of Care: Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT)</h3>
<p>As of 2025, Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) remains the most effective pharmacologic intervention for VMS, capable of reducing symptom frequency and severity by 75% to 90%.</p>
<p>MHT functions by exogenously replacing 17β-estradiol. The systemic estrogen crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to ERα on KNDy neurons. This restores the negative feedback loop, suppressing NKB secretion and widening the thermoneutral zone.</p>

<h3>Novel Non-Hormonal Medications: Neurokinin Receptor Antagonists</h3>
<p>The translation of the KNDy neuron hypothesis into clinical therapeutics has resulted in the development of neurokinin receptor antagonists. This class represents the first targeted, non-hormonal biological approach to VMS.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Comparison of NK3 and Dual NK1/3 Antagonists</p>
</div>

<h4>Fezolinetant (Veozah)</h4>
<p>Fezolinetant, developed by Astellas, is a first-in-class, selective <strong>neurokinin-3 (NK3) receptor antagonist</strong> approved by the FDA in May 2023. It binds with high affinity to NK3 receptors in the hypothalamus, blocking the binding of NKB released by hyperactive KNDy neurons, thereby preventing the activation of heat-dissipation effectors.</p>

<h4>Elinzanetant (Lynkuet)</h4>
<p>Elinzanetant, developed by Bayer, is a second-generation antagonist that targets <strong>both NK1 and NK3 receptors</strong>. Approved by the FDA in October 2025, it distinguishes itself via this dual mechanism:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>NK3 Antagonism:</strong> Blocks the NKB-mediated hot flash trigger.</li>
    <li><strong>NK1 Antagonism:</strong> Blocks the Substance P receptor. Since Substance P is involved in sleep regulation and mood, the inclusion of NK1 antagonism provides superior relief for menopause-associated sleep disturbances.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Investigational Drugs</h3>
<p>Beyond the approved medications, several other drugs are undergoing clinical trials.</p>

<h4>GeneScience Pharmaceuticals: GS1–144</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Investigational NK3 antagonist targeting the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center.</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Phase 2 development. A bioavailability study (NCT06983925) comparing new tablet formulations was listed in mid-2025.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tioga Pharma: Asimadoline</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> A peripherally restricted <strong>Kappa Opioid Receptor Agonist</strong>. Since the KNDy system involves dynorphin (an opioid peptide), stimulating the kappa opioid receptor is hypothesized to help terminate the hyperactivity of the pulse generator (targeting the "brake" rather than the "accelerator").</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> A Phase 2a trial is evaluating efficacy in women with moderate-to-severe VMS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The management of vasomotor symptoms has evolved from a monolithic era of estrogen replacement to a nuanced landscape of targeted neurobiology. The discovery of the KNDy neuron system has not only explained the etiology of the hot flash but has delivered a new class of high-efficacy drugs.</p>
