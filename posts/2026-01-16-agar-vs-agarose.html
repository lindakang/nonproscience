<p>Most researchers in molecular biology laboratories have used both agar and agarose. While most know that agar is used for culture media and agarose is used for DNA gels, do you know the chemical and structural differences between the two?</p>

<h3>Agar</h3>
<p>As most people likely know, agar is extracted from seaweed. The four main types of algae sources are: Rhodophyta (red algae), Phaeophyta (brown algae), Cyanophyta (blue-green algae), and Chlorophyta (green algae). <strong>Red algae</strong> serve as the primary source of agar.</p>

<h4>Composition</h4>
<p>Agar is composed of approximately <strong>70% agarose and 30% agaropectin</strong>. Agarose is purified directly from agar. While the backbone for both is galactose, agaropectin is modified by various acidic substances, including sulfate, glycuronate, and pyruvate, resulting in a more diverse range of ionic moieties.</p>
<p>Due to its significantly lower cost compared to agarose, agar is typically used for microbial culture media. It is unsuitable for DNA gel electrophoresis for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Diverse Ionic Moieties:</strong> The presence of charged groups affects migration.</li>
    <li><strong>Purity:</strong> It is not as pure as agarose, resulting in poorer resolution which may compromise experimental results.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Anecdotes</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The 1982 Paper:</strong> However, it is not impossible to use it for running DNA. A paper from 1982 stated that due to the high cost of agarose at the time, researchers attempted to use bacto-agar for DNA electrophoresis, and the results were actually not poor. (One wonders, just how much did agarose cost in 1982?)</li>
    <li><strong>STEM Camps:</strong> Additionally, it has been noted that some summer camps allow high school students to use agar for casting and running gels because it is cheaper; this way, using too much or making mistakes is less heartbreaking (and financially painful).</li>
</ul>

    <strong>Reddit discussion:</strong><br>
    I also saw a post on Reddit where a user mentioned they weren't paying attention and grabbed agar to run DNA. Since the results were decent, they didn't realize they had used the wrong material. Later, when they grabbed the wrong bottle a second time, their boss happened to see and asked why they were using agar. It was only then that they realized they had used agar the previous time as well, leading to a dilemma about whether to admit to the boss that the previous run was also done with agar, so they came online to ask for opinions. 😂

<h3>Agarose</h3>
<p>Agarose is a linear polysaccharide purified from agar. It consists of repeating units of agarobiose, which is a disaccharide made of β-D-galactopyranose and 3,6-anhydro-α-L-galactopyranose.</p>
<p>When these polysaccharides form fibres, they create a mesh with pore sizes ranging from approximately <strong>50 nm to 200 nm</strong>, depending on the concentration percentage. Due to its high purity and stability, agarose is the standard for DNA gel electrophoresis.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Standard Concentration:</strong> Typically 0.7% to 1%.</li>
    <li><strong>Small Fragments:</strong> For DNA fragments smaller than 500 bp, a higher concentration is required to effectively resolve similar sizes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Can Agarose be Used for Culture Media?</h3>
<p>Technically, it should work, but it is just more expensive; the boss would be heartbroken. Someone on Reddit mistakenly used agarose, but it seems they threw it away later.</p>

<h3>Can Edible Agar be Used for Lab Media?</h3>
<p>Conversely, a paper found on ResearchGate explored whether food-grade agar could replace laboratory-grade agar for bacterial culture. The conclusion was <strong>yes</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Price Difference</h3>
<p>The price difference is significant and explains the strict segregation of their use in the laboratory. Using Sigma-Aldrich pricing as a benchmark:</p>

<table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #d0d7de;">
        <td style="padding: 10px;"><strong>100 g Agar</strong></td>
        <td style="padding: 10px;">~ $100 CAD</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #d0d7de;">
        <td style="padding: 10px;"><strong>100 g Agarose</strong></td>
        <td style="padding: 10px;">~ $574 CAD</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Agarose is <strong>more than 5 times more expensive</strong> than agar.</p>
