<p>Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), founded in 1876, is a centennial global pharmaceutical leader dedicated to discovering and marketing therapies for a wide range of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune diseases. The company boasts a diverse portfolio featuring established leaders like <strong>Trulicity</strong> (dulaglutide), the breast cancer therapy <strong>Verzenio</strong> (abemaciclib), and the psoriasis treatment <strong>Taltz</strong>.</p>
<p>Currently, its growth is driven by the highly successful GLP-1 receptor agonists <strong>Mounjaro</strong> (tirzepatide) and <strong>Zepbound</strong> (tirzepatide). Lilly's current market valuation reflects strong investor confidence, primarily anchored in its competitive advantage in the weight loss market. Despite increasing competition—most notably from Novo Nordisk—Lilly is aggressively expanding its pipeline beyond weight management.</p>

    <li><strong>Trulicity (dulaglutide):</strong> A foundational GLP-1 agonist. Despite patent expiry pressures (2027), it generated $7.1 billion in 2024.</li>
    <li><strong>Verzenio (abemaciclib):</strong> A CDK4/6 inhibitor for HR+, HER2- breast cancer ($5.31 billion in 2024).</li>
    <li><strong>Jardiance (empagliflozin):</strong> An SGLT2 inhibitor for diabetes and heart failure ($3.34 billion in 2024).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recent Approvals and Near-Term Pipeline</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kisunla™ (donanemab-azbt):</strong> Anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) mAb approved in July 2024 for early Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
    <li><strong>Tirzepatide (HFpEF Label Expansion):</strong> Phase 3 SUMMIT trial showed a 38% reduction in heart failure events. Submissions to FDA/EMA are under review.</li>

    <li><strong>Ebglyss (lebrikizumab):</strong> IL-13 antagonist for atopic dermatitis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Phase 3 and Early-Stage Candidates</h3>
<div class="image-container">

    <li><strong>Muvalaplin:</strong> Oral small molecule inhibiting Lp(a) formation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategic Acquisitions (2025 Focus)</h3>
<p>Lilly utilizes a "bolt-on" acquisition strategy to acquire specific assets or technologies.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scorpion Therapeutics:</strong> Acquired for up to $2.5 billion. Gained <strong>STX-478</strong>, a mutant-selective PI3Kα inhibitor for breast cancer.</li>
    <li><strong>SiteOne Therapeutics:</strong> Acquired for up to $1 billion. Gained <strong>STC-004</strong>, a non-opioid pain therapeutic (Nav1.8 inhibitor).</li>
    <li><strong>Verve Therapeutics:</strong> Acquired for up to $1.3 billion. Includes <strong>VERVE-102</strong>, a base-editing gene therapy for ASCVD targeting PCSK9.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Financial Performance</h3>
<p>Lilly delivered exceptional financial results in recent quarters, driven by insatiable demand for obesity and diabetes treatments.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>FY 2024:</strong> Revenue grew 32% to <strong>$45.04 billion</strong>. Net income surged 102% to $10.59 billion.</li>
    <li><strong>Q1 2025:</strong> Global revenue reached $12.73 billion (+45% YoY).
        <ul>
            <li>Mounjaro: $3.84 billion (+112.7% YoY)</li>
            <li>Zepbound: $2.31 billion (+346.8% YoY)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Competitive Landscape</h3>
<h4>Obesity & Diabetes</h4>
<p><strong>Novo Nordisk (Semaglutide):</strong> The primary competitor with Wegovy/Ozempic. Lilly’s Zepbound has shown superior weight loss efficacy in head-to-head comparisons. Novo is advancing oral semaglutide (Rybelsus).</p>

<h4>Oncology (PI3Kα Inhibitors)</h4>
<p><strong>Novartis (Piqray):</strong> Targets both mutant and wild-type PI3Kα, causing hyperglycemia. Lilly’s <strong>STX-478</strong> is mutant-selective, potentially offering a better safety profile.</p>

<h4>Cardiovascular (Lp(a) & PCSK9)</h4>
<p>Lilly faces competition from Amgen (Olpasiran) and Silence Therapeutics in the siRNA space. However, Lilly’s <strong>Lepodisiran</strong> differentiates with a potentially longer duration of action (1.5 years). In the PCSK9 space, Lilly’s acquisition of Verve targets a "one-and-done" gene editing cure, distinct from chronic dosing injectables like Repatha.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Eli Lilly and Company remains a dominant force in the pharmaceutical industry. With Mounjaro and Zepbound poised to lead the global market, 2024 saw revenue jump 32%. Despite upcoming patent cliffs for older drugs like Trulicity, Lilly’s aggressive acquisition strategy in oncology, immunology, and genetic medicine—combined with high-potential pipeline assets like oral GLP-1s (Orforglipron)—positions the company for sustained long-term growth.</p>
