<p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous research teams—alongside major pharmaceutical companies developing standard antibody treatments—have published studies utilizing nanobodies to treat COVID-19. But what exactly are nanobodies, and how do they differ from the commonly known IgG antibody drugs?</p>

<h3>A Serendipitous Discovery</h3>
<p>The discovery of nanobodies was an accident. In the 1980s, biology students at the Free University of Brussels (VUB) in Belgium were tasked with extracting antibodies from human serum during a lab course. Fearing infection, the students refused to work with human samples. As an alternative, the faculty provided frozen camel serum stored in the freezer.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, they discovered that camel serum contained not only the standard IgG (~150 kDa) but also a unique type of antibody composed solely of heavy chains, known as <strong>Heavy Chain Antibodies (HCAb, ~90 kDa)</strong> [1, 2]. The variable region of these HCAbs—the variable domain of the heavy chain (VHH)—is known as a <strong>nanobody</strong> or single-domain antibody (sdAb).</p>
<p>Despite their small size (~15 kDa), nanobodies exhibit specificity and affinity comparable to traditional IgG. Following this discovery, VUB began extensive research on VHH. In 2001, VUB and VIB (Flanders Institute for Biotechnology) spun off this technology to co-found <strong>Ablynx</strong> [3], a biotech company eventually acquired by Sanofi in 2018 for €3.9 billion [4, 5].</p>

<h3>Nanobodies vs. IgG: Structure and Manufacturing</h3>
<p>While standard IgG possesses two variable regions (Fv), nanobodies derived from Camelids (camels, llamas, alpacas) contain only one Fv. Despite lacking a light chain, their affinity and specificity for antigens are not inferior to IgG. In fact, their structural simplicity offers distinct developmental advantages.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Production Costs:</strong> The constant region (Fc) of standard IgG requires glycosylation, a process that only occurs within animal cells. Consequently, IgG production relies on expensive mammalian cell culture. In contrast, nanobodies lack the Fc region and can be mass-produced in <em>E. coli</em> or yeast. These systems offer higher yields and significantly lower production costs compared to mammalian cells.</li>
    <li><strong>Tissue Penetration & Stability:</strong> Due to their smaller size and distinct structural composition, nanobodies can penetrate tissues more effectively than IgG. They also exhibit better solubility, reducing the risk of aggregation [6].</li>
    <li><strong>Pharmacokinetics:</strong> The primary drawback of the nanobody's small size is a shorter half-life, leading to rapid metabolic clearance. However, this can be mitigated by linking multiple nanobodies together (multimerization) to extend their duration in the body.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clinical Applications: Oncology and Hematology</h3>
<p>Scientists are leveraging the advantages of nanobodies—high affinity, high specificity, and deep tumor penetration—for clinical applications, particularly in nanobody-drug conjugates for cancer therapy. Current Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials focus largely on targets such as PD-L1 and HER2 (breast cancer) [5].</p>
<p>Beyond oncology, there have been significant successes in hematology:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Caplacizumab (CABLIVI®):</strong> Developed by Sanofi/Ablynx for the treatment of acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (aTTP), this drug targets the von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF is a protein that facilitates platelet adhesion; in aTTP patients, small blood vessels form clots without physiological need. Caplacizumab prevents this pathological clotting. It received EMA approval in 2018 and FDA approval in 2019, becoming the first approved nanobody drug worldwide [5, 8]. Real-world data confirms its superior efficacy [5, 9].</li>
    <li><strong>Ozoralizumab (ATN-103):</strong> An Ablynx-developed nanobody for Rheumatoid Arthritis. It completed Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan earlier this year and is currently under review by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. If approved, it will be Japan's first nanobody therapeutic [10].</li>
</ul>

<h3>The New Battlefield: Inhalable Nanobodies for COVID-19</h3>
<p>Following the FDA approval of caplacizumab, interest in nanobodies surged. This intensified during the pandemic, with multiple teams investigating anti-Spike nanobodies for SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Recently, the University of Pittsburgh published preliminary results on <strong>PiN-21</strong>, an inhalable nanobody treatment. In hamster models infected with COVID-19, those treated with a low intranasal dose (0.6 mg/kg) of PiN-21 showed no weight loss and had undetectable viral loads in the lungs after 10 days, compared to the control group. Efficacy was maintained when administered via a nebulizer [11, 12].</p>
<p>Unlike IgG drugs, which require high-dose intravenous administration, inhalable nanobodies offer a convenient and cost-effective alternative [12]. Although still in the pre-clinical stage, nanobodies represent a promising new frontier in infectious disease management if clinical trials confirm these results.</p>
