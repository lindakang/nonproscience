<p>Antibody drugs come in various forms. Beyond traditional IgG antibodies, there are smaller molecules like scFv (single-chain fragment variable) and VHHs, also known as nanobodies, which are found only in sharks and camelids.</p>
<p>This article aims to summarize the applications of antibodies, many of which are developed for cancer treatment, including bi-specific antibodies and ADCs (antibody-drug conjugates).</p>

<h3>Bi-specific Abs</h3>
<p>Antibodies can be designed to be bi-specific, meaning their Fv regions target different antigens. This concept was first proposed by Nisonoff and colleagues in a 1960 publication in <em>Science</em>. However, it wasn’t until nearly fifty years later, in 2009, that the first FDA-approved bispecific antibody drug, <strong>catumaxomab (Removab®)</strong>, was developed by the German biotech company Fresenius Biotech GmbH.</p>
<p>Bi-specific antibodies can link immune cells to cancer cells (in-trans binding), bringing them into proximity, typically through the CD3 receptor on T cells. These engineered antibodies are known as <strong>T-cell engagers (TCEs)</strong>. Removab is one such antibody, binding T cell CD3 on one side and cancer cell EpCAM on the other. Its Fc region serves as a third binding site, interacting with Fcγ receptors on other immune cells, such as macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells.</p>

<h3>Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs)</h3>
<p>Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are commonly used in cancer treatment by conjugating chemotherapy drugs to antibodies. The antibody targets and delivers the chemo drug into cancer cells, where it is then released. This approach improves drug specificity, enhances treatment efficacy, and reduces damage to normal, healthy cells.</p>

<h4>ADC Structure and Design</h4>
<p>ADCs consist of three components: the antibody, the linker, and the payload. IgG1 is the most commonly used antibody due to its stability, long half-life of 14–21 days, and its ability to recruit innate immune cells through Fcγ receptors (FcγRs), such as macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. IgG1 also has lower immunogenicity, reducing the risk of anti-drug antibody formation and excessive immune responses.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Structure of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs)</p>
</div>

<p>The payload, typically a highly toxic chemotherapy drug, includes agents like MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E), MMAF (monomethyl auristatin F), and maytansine derivatives DM1 and DM4. The linker connecting the antibody and drug can be either cleavable or non-cleavable, with cleavable linkers being the most commonly used today due to their ability to release the drug in a controlled manner within cancer cells.</p>

<h4>Antibody-Drug Conjugates on the Market</h4>
<p>Currently, there are 13 FDA-approved cancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), covering over 20 indications, primarily for blood cancers and solid tumors.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>KADCYLA® (trastuzumab emtansine):</strong> The first FDA-approved ADC for solid tumours (Genentech), approved in 2013 for late-stage breast cancer. It uses an IgG1 antibody that targets HER2 and carries the drug DM1.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan):</strong> Developed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca, approved in 2019. It uses an IgG1 antibody targeting HER2-expressing cancer cells with DXd (a topoisomerase I inhibitor) as its payload. Recently approved for non-small cell lung cancer, bringing its total indications to five.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Radionuclide Antibody Conjugate (RACs)</h3>
<p>Besides ADCs carrying chemotherapy drugs, there are also antibodies conjugated to radioisotopes, which have gained popularity in recent years. Their advantage over ADCs is that they can not only kill cancer cells but also be used to monitor tumour response and drug absorption. Similar to ADCs, RACs offer higher specificity than conventional radiotherapies.</p>

</div>

<p>To date, only two RACs have been FDA-approved:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan):</strong> Approved in 2002, uses iodine-131 and targets CD20 for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</li>
    <li><strong>Bexxar (tositumomab):</strong> Approved in 2003, employs yttrium-90 (Y-90) and also targets CD20 for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Degrader-Antibody Conjugates (DACs)</h3>
<p>Antibodies can also be linked to degraders, which is known as <strong>targeted protein degradation (TPD)</strong>. TPD usually utilizes the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). It uses E3 ligase to tag target proteins with ubiquitin (Ub), allowing them to be degraded by the proteasome. The method employs molecular glue, small molecules that can bring E3 ligase and target proteins together, enabling the target protein to be tagged by E3 ligase and degraded by the proteasome.</p>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="assets/images/20240930-Antibody/PROTAC.png" alt="PROTAC">
    <p class="image-caption">PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera)</p>
</div>

<p>Another approach similar to molecular glue is Arvinas’s <strong>PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera)</strong>. PROTAC consists of a ligand for E3 ligase, a ligand for the target protein, and a linker that brings the target protein to E3 ligase for tagging and degradation. PROTAC was first published in PNAS in 2001 by Dr. Craig Crews from Yale University, who then founded Arvinas in 2013. Most of their drugs are still in phase I clinical trials, but their oral drug Vepdegestrant (ARV-471) for ER+/HER2- breast cancer has entered phase III clinical trials. It is co-developed and commercialized with Pfizer since 2011.</p>
<p>Both PROTAC and molecular glue can be conjugated to antibodies. The antibody targets antigens on the cancer cell surface and brings PROTAC or molecular glue into the cell. After internalization, molecular glues or PROTAC bring the target protein to E3 ligase for degradation.</p>

<p>Biotech companies that focus on DACs include Orum Therapeutics, a Korean biotech company founded in 2016. They currently have only two drugs in phase I clinical trials. Their ORM-5029 (TPD2-GSPT1) targets HER2+, where the DAC enters the cell by binding to HER2 and then releases molecular glue (SMol007). SMol007 subsequently brings the target protein GSPT1 (translation termination factor) to E3 ligase for degradation, leading to cancer cell death. ORM-6151/BMS-986497 is designed to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the antibody targeting CD33 and killing cancer cells by degrading GSPT1 after entering the cell. The drug was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) at the end of 2023.</p>

<h3>Antibody-Oligonucleotide Conjugates (AOCs)</h3>
<p>AOCs (Antibody-Oligonucleotide Conjugates) have also emerged in recent years. Methods for conjugation include direct conjugation, ionic interactions, or binding between avidin and biotin.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Methods of AOC conjugation</p>
</div>

<p>Current developments mostly focus on using siRNA and ASO. One challenge is stability; previous studies showed a half-life of 1.9 days in serum. Companies focusing on AOCs include <strong>Avidity Biosciences</strong>. Their AOC1001 (Del-desiran) employs siRNA to treat DM1 (myotonic dystrophy type 1) and has progressed to Phase III clinical trials.</p>

<h3>Extracellular vesicles (EVs)-Fc</h3>
<p>A recent study published in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em> by Sweden’s Karolinska University involved introducing vectors carrying genes for anti-Fc proteins or domains (such as Protein A/G) into EV-producing cells. These EVs displaying antibodies can load chemotherapy drugs inside, demonstrating promising efficacy in mice.</p>

<h3>Antibody-Cell Conjugation (ACC)</h3>
<p>Antibody-cell conjugation (ACC) links antibodies with immune cells, such as NK cells or CIK cells. It was first proposed by Sonny Hsiao in 2009. There are two methods for coupling antibodies to cells:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Metabolic Sugar Engineering:</strong> Non-natural monosaccharide analogs are taken up and expressed on the cell surface, allowing antibody attachment via bioorthogonal reactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Chemoenzymatic Methods:</strong> Glycosylases are used to modify glycocalyxes on the cell surface for conjugation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, <strong>Acepodia</strong>, founded by Hsiao, is working on ACC.</p>
